# What is PyRelay?

PyRelay is a python implementation of a NOSTR Relay, using asyncio.
Don't know whats NOSTR is? check it out [here](https://nostr.com/).

# Quick start

### Installing

PyRelay require python 3.11.
I suggest setting up virtual env before running locally.

Install using git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnny423/pyrelay
cd pyrelay
```

### Run with docker compose

```bash
docker compose up
```

### Install Locally

Install dependencies, without dev dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have trouble with installing `secp256k1` try executing
```bash
pip install wheel
```
then
```bash
python setup.py bdist_wheel 
```
and rerun  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the server locally

```bash
python ./pyrelay/relay/server.py
```

# Developer Setup

Download and install the latest version of git.

Configure git with your username and email.

```bash
git config --global user.name 'your name'
git config --global user.email 'your email'
```

Make sure you have a GitHub account.

Clone the repository locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnny423/pyrelay
cd pyrelay
```

Install dependencies, include dev dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt -r requirements-tests.txt
```

### Running tests

You can run the tests with the scripts

```bash
./scripts/test.sh
```
